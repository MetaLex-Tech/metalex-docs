# MetaLeX OS Introduction

MetaLeX OS is an open framework that brings legal entities and their operations — governance, agreements, transactions, and even equity — onto the blockchain.

In plain terms: **it turns traditional organizations into cybernetic organizations**. These entities have built-in smart contracts that handle many of the decisions, rules, and transactions that used to require manual or paper processes. The result is a legal entity that is faster, more transparent, and more autonomous.

By merging **code and law**, MetaLeX OS enables DAOs, companies, and funds to:

- Automate governance and compliance rules.
- Execute agreements and transactions directly on-chain.
- Operate with the efficiency of DeFi while remaining legally compliant.

> **Key takeaway:** MetaLeX OS is like an *operating system* for legally compliant, blockchain-based organizations. It replaces “wet contracts” (traditional paper/legal agreements) with “dry code” (smart contracts) where possible, without losing enforceability.

## What's Inside

The documentation is organized into the major building blocks of MetaLeX OS:

- 🤖 **BORGs** — Cybernetic organizations (legal wrappers + smart contracts).
- 🏢 **cyberCORPs** — On-chain corporate structures for fundraising and equity.
- 💼 **cyberDeals** — Smart, enforceable funding agreements.
- ⚖️ **Cybernetic Law** — The principles and legal designs underpinning the system.

If you are:
- A **developer** — see [BORG Core](../borgs/core) for the contract architecture.
- A **DAO user** — start with [How-to BORG](../borgs/how-to).
- A **lawyer or advisor** — read [Cybernetic Law](../cybernetic-law/intro) for the legal foundations.
