# Welcome to MetaLeX

MetaLeX builds legal and technical infrastructure for [cyBernetic ORGanizations ("BORGs")](/borg/what-is-a-BORG) and other onchain entities like [cyberCORPs](/cybercorps). Our tools combine blockchain automation with robust legal frameworks to help communities coordinate, govern, and transact with confidence.

We are cypherpunk lawyers, engineers, and anons aiming to solve the currently unsolvable problems in crypto, AI, and finance via cyBernetic ORGanizations.

We strive: (1) in the short-run, to improve efficiency, compliance, trust, and access to justice by integrating autonomous technologies into the legal and governance processes of legal entities; and (2) in the long-run, to empower the legal, governance and dealmaking aspects of new cybernetic societies that enhance human freedom and prosperity.

Explore the areas linked in the sidebar to learn more about what we're building, including the [MetaLeX OS](/metalex-os-intro).
