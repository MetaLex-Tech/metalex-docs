# Welcome to MetaLeX

MetaLeX builds legal and technical infrastructure for [cyBernetic ORGanizations ("BORGs")](/borg/intro-to-borgs) and other onchain entities like [cyberCORPs](/cybercorps). Our tools combine blockchain automation with robust legal frameworks to help communities coordinate, govern, and transact with confidence.

Explore the areas linked in the sidebar to learn more about what we're building, including the [MetaLeX OS](/metalex-os-intro).
