## Welcome to MetaLeX OS

MetaLeX OS is the 'operating system' for cyBernetic ORGanizations, also as known as 'BORGs'--legal entities that are tightly coupled with blockchain technology to achieve governance-accountable, trust-minimized, transaction-automated and legally optimized governance structures.
MetaLeX OS consists of a system of BORG-optimized smart contracts, legal documents, offchain legal entity structures, and a web application for monitoring, operating and transacting with BORGs.
