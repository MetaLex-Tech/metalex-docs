# DAO Member Guide

DAO token holders can influence a BORG’s actions through onchain votes. This guide explains how to participate.

---

## How Voting Works

1. **Find active proposals**  
   In the DAO interface (e.g., MetaLeX, Snapshot, Tally, or your custom front end), look for proposals tagged with your BORG’s name.

2. **Review proposal details**  
   Click a proposal to read the full description, rationale, and any linked documents.

3. **Cast your vote**  
   Select **For**, **Against**, or **Abstain**, then confirm via your connected wallet.

4. **Execution**  
   If the proposal passes, the result is relayed to the BORG, which then carries out the action automatically (e.g., funding a project, changing a setting).

**Example:**  
If a `grantsBORG` proposes *“Allocate 10,000 USDC to Developer Bounty”*, token holders can vote to approve or reject it. If approved, the BORG’s smart contracts disburse the funds per the proposal terms — no manual steps needed.
