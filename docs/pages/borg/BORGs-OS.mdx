# ðŸ–– Welcome to BORGs OS

BORGs OS is the 'operating system' for cyBernetic ORGanizations, also as known as 'BORGs'--legal entities that are tightly coupled with blockchain technology to achieve governance-accountable, trust-minimized, transaction-automated and legally optimized governance structures.

BORGs OS consists of a system of BORG-optimized smart contracts, legal documents, offchain legal entity structures, and a web application for monitoring, operating and transacting with BORGs.

Version 1 of BORG OS combines SAFE-compatible smart contracts and legal tooling to manufacture custom BORGs that separate powers between offchain entities and onchain automation. Built on the battle-tested Gnosis SAFE framework, it uses Guards to enforce pre- and post-transaction checks and Modules to automate actions like allowances, timelocks or ragequits. Together these components aim to create governance-accountable, trust-minimized and legally optimized multisig systems.
