# Governance Adapters

Governance adapters bridge borgCORE with external DAO governance systems, allowing a BORG to route proposals through specialized voting contracts.

- [`baseGovernanceAdapater.sol`](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/borg-core/blob/main/src/libs/governance/baseGovernanceAdapater.sol) – abstract interface that defines common methods for creating, executing, and cancelling proposals and for retrieving vote totals.
- [`flexGovernanceAdapater.sol`](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/borg-core/blob/main/src/libs/governance/flexGovernanceAdapater.sol) – implementation that connects to Flexa DAO's FlexGov contract and exposes proposal and vote management tailored to that system.

These adapters let developers plug borgCORE into different governance frameworks without modifying the core contract itself.
