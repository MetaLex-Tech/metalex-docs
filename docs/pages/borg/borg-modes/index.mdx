# BORG Modes

The borgCore is the central hub for onchain BORGs. Its main purpose is to define the policy that governs which actions BORG members may take on chain. It extends the Gnosis Safe guard functionality.

<CardGrid>

**There are 3 types of BORG modes:**
    <Card
      title="Whitelist"
      link="/borg/borg-modes/whitelist"
    >
      <span>
        Only pre-approved addresses or calldata may execute transactions.
      </span>
    </Card>
      <Card
      title="Blacklist"
      link="/borg/borg-modes/blacklist"
    >
      <span>
        Transactions from blacklisted addresses or calldata are blocked.
      </span>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Unrestricted" link="/borg/borg-modes/unrestricted">
      <span>
        No allow or deny lists are enforced by the core.
      </span>
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Whitelist

- All transactions are blocked unless explicitly pre‑approved.
- Native token transfers must target whitelisted recipients and may include per‑tx limits.
- Calls are limited to whitelisted contracts and methods, with parameter constraints such as type, ranges or exact values.
- Best for highly conservative BORGs holding significant value, like finBORGs or tightly controlled grants programs.

### Blacklist

- Transactions are permitted by default except those explicitly denied.
- Addresses on the blacklist cannot receive transfers.
- Contract calls or specific methods may be blocked unless parameters satisfy defined constraints.
- Useful for trusted teams needing broad discretion while avoiding a short list of risky actions.

### Unrestricted

- No allow or deny lists are enforced.
- Signers have full discretion over transactions but can still use implants or other MetaLeX tooling for optional safeguards.
- Suitable for experimentation or situations where members are highly trusted.

Both whitelist and blacklist modes can enforce cooldown periods on certain calls to prevent spammy proposals or denial‑of‑service patterns.
