## finBORGs / pbvBORGS

finBORGs handle the efforts of protocol beneficial value (PBV) and token management operations. They can be used to manage the vesting of tokens, the distribution of tokens, and the management of token-based incentives. finBORGs can also be used to manage the treasury of a DAO or protocol, and to manage the financial operations of a DAO or protocol.

With MetaLeX's modular design, finBORGs can use onchain implants to enhance or customize the BORG to your needs.
