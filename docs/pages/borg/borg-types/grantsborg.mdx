# grantBORGs

**grantBORGs** are responsible for managing and distributing grants to projects, developers, and other initiatives that align with the goals and objectives of the associated DAO. These BORGs act as a bridge between the DAO and the wider ecosystem, identifying opportunities for investment and growth.

<Callout>
  An example is the [Neutron Grants
  BORG](https://forum.neutron.org/t/approved-proposal-14-launching-the-neutron-grants-program/95).
</Callout>

These BORGS follow a transparent and accountable process for evaluating grant proposals, making funding decisions, and monitoring the progress of funded projects. By doing so, Grant BORGs help ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the DAO and its ecosystem. Grant BORGs likely require a greater amount of social versatility and cannot be constrained as much through onchain logic.

<Callout>
  For example, there could be a rule that any single grant in excess of $250k of
  value requires the vote of both the management of the Grant BORG and a
  majority of the DAO-and this could be enforced through onchain logic (e.g. if
  BORG holds funds in multisig, expenditures over $250k require multisig
  supermajority with DAO being one of the votes).
</Callout>

Grant BORGs present particularly sensitive tax issues because they are, in effect, paying service providers (with potential to be responsible for tax withholding, tax reporting, social security contributions, VAT, etc.), and thus there might be a need for multiple Grant BORGs in different jurisdictions where grant recipients reside.

With MetaLeX's modular design, grantBORGs can use onchain implants to enhance or customize the BORG to their needs.
