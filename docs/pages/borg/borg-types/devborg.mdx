## devBORGs

devBORGs are BORGs that manage the development and deployment of smart contracts and other technical assets for a DAO or protocol. They are responsible for the technical operations of a DAO, including the deployment of new smart contracts, the management of technical assets, and the coordination of technical resources.

With MetaLeX's modular design, devBORGs can use onchain implants to enhance or customize the BORG to your needs.
