## allianceBORGs

Alliance BORGs hold and manage token positions of aligned communities and strategic partners. They consolidate cross-DAO stakes and steward relationships to advance mutual goals.

<Callout>
  An example is the [Lido Alliance BORG](https://research.lido.fi/t/organize-the-lido-alliance-program-as-a-lido-dao-adjacent-borg/8173).
</Callout>

With MetaLeX's modular design, allianceBORGs can use onchain implants to enhance or customize the BORG to their needs.
