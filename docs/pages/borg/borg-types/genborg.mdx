## genBORGs

genBORGs are generalBORGs, short for general purpose BORGs, that can be used for a wide variety of purposes. Handling Human-in-the-loop functionality for protocols, they can assist anywhere a DAO needs interaction with the physical or legal world.

With MetaLeX's modular design, genBORGs can use onchain implants to enhance or customize the BORG to your needs.
