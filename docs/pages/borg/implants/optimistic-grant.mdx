# Optimistic Grant

Automatically approves grants after a waiting period unless vetoed by the DAO.

- Small requests execute quickly while giving token holders time to react.
- Any participant may submit a veto transaction during the cooldown.
- If no veto arrives before the window closes, the grant executes through the BORG core.

Optimistic grants accelerate routine disbursements without sacrificing accountability.
