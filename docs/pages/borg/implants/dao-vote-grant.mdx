# DAO Vote Grant

Requires a proposal to win a DAO token holder vote before the BORG core releases funds.

- A grant proposal is created in the governance system and connected to the implant.
- After the vote, if quorum and approval thresholds are met, the BORG core disburses funds.
- Proposals that fail or expire are never executed, preserving community control of the treasury.

This ensures grants align with DAO consensus.
