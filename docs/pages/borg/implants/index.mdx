# Implants

Implants are plug-in SAFE modules for MetaLeX OS. They pair a `ConditionManager` with a `BorgAuth` contract so outside accounts or smart contracts can influence the BORG core under programmable rules. Implants add extra checks or execute transactions when conditions are satisfied.

Examples include:

- **Optimistic Grant implant** – lets a GrantsBORG issue grants within rate limits and routes larger requests through a DAO timelock and veto process.
- **DAO veto implant** – queues transactions with a timelock that the DAO can cancel.
- **Eject implant** – allows a signer to resign or be removed by the DAO, supporting rapid key rotation.
- **Fail Safe implant** – redirects funds to a predefined address if signer thresholds fall below a safe minimum.

Each implant can evaluate [conditions](/borg/conditions) such as signatures, time delays, token balances or oracle inputs to tailor policy.
