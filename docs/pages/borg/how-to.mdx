# How-to BORG

This guide walks you through using the **MetaLeX OS** web app as a BORG member.

> **Who this is for:** Multisig signers and other authorized members of a BORG, typically acting as directors, officers, or committee members.

## Step-by-Step

1. **Connect your wallet**  
   Click **Connect Wallet** in the top right. Once connected, the app will display your address and current role in the BORG.

2. **Select your BORG**  
   From the dashboard, choose the BORG you want to operate. If no BORGs appear, ensure your wallet address has been added as a member.

3. **Check your permissions**  
   The interface will show whether you can propose transactions, approve them, or both. Your permissions are based on your on-chain role (set in `BorgAuth`).

4. **Propose or approve a transaction**  
   - To propose: Go to the **Transactions** tab, fill in the recipient, amount, and any data, then click **Submit**.  
   - To approve: Navigate to **Pending Transactions**, review the details, and click **Approve**.

5. **Track execution**  
   Once the required approvals are collected, the transaction executes automatically on-chain.
