# Helpers

Utility contracts used across borgCORE live in the helpers library.

- [`signatureHelper.sol`](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/borg-core/blob/main/src/libs/helpers/signatureHelper.sol) â€“ verifies signatures for Gnosis Safe transactions. It reconstructs the Safe's EIP-712 transaction hash, recovers signer addresses, and returns the set of signers up to the Safe's threshold.
