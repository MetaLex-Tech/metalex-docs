# DAO Member Guide

MetaLeX OS lets DAO token holders monitor and influence the BORGs that serve their communities.

<Callout>
  The actions you can take depend on the governance rights attached to your tokens.
</Callout>

## Basic workflow

1. **Connect your wallet** using the button in the upper-right corner.
2. **Review available proposals** for BORG actions or onchain votes.
3. **Cast your vote** or sign off on transactions when prompted by the interface.
4. **Track results** to see when approved actions execute onchain.
