# borgCORE

[`borg-core`](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/borg-core) is the onchain policy engine that powers MetaLeX BORGs. It combines a SAFE Guard with the standard ERC‑4824 DAO interface, making it the "heart" of every BORG on MetaLeX OS. By wrapping a SAFE with conditional, policy‑driven checks, it enforces which actions multisig members may execute and how outside authorities interact with the BORG.

## Architecture

- **Immutable modes** – each core is deployed in whitelist, blacklist or unrestricted mode. The mode cannot be changed after deployment.
- **BorgAuth** – access control layer that governs who may update policy or install implants.
- **Condition Manager** – modular AND/OR checks for per‑function or per‑contract conditions (e.g., timelocks, balances, oracle data).
- **On‑chain references** – stores URIs for legal documents and the adjacent DAO's EIP‑4824 interface.
- **Implants** – SAFE Modules that plug into the core to add features such as optimistic grants, timelocks or signer ejections.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/borg-core
cd borg-core
foundryup           # Update Foundry tools
forge install       # Install project dependencies
forge build --optimize --optimizer-runs 200 --use solc:0.8.20 --via-ir
```

The contracts can then be deployed with your preferred tooling.

## Next Steps

Learn about [BORG modes](/os/borg/borg-modes), [conditions](/os/borg/conditions), and [implants](/os/borg/implants) to customize how your organization operates.
