# Fail Safe

Provides emergency pause or recovery actions if the BORG core becomes compromised.

Typical configurations include:

- Monitoring signer thresholds and redirecting funds to a designated recovery address if too many keys are lost.
- Pausing outbound transactions while the DAO investigates suspicious activity.
- Offering an escape hatch that a guardian can trigger.

Use the failâ€‘safe as a last line of defense for safeguarding treasury assets.
