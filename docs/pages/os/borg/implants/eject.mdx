# Eject

Removes a member or module from the BORG when predefined conditions are satisfied.

- A signer may resign and trigger key rotation.
- The DAO can force-remove compromised or inactive participants.
- Modules that fall out of compliance can be revoked.

The eject implant keeps BORG membership and connected contracts healthy over time.
