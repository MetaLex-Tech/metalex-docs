# "How-to" BORG

# ![Logo](/borg-connect.png)

Get started with BORGs in MetaLeX OS. To unlock actions based on your connected wallet's privileges, click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner of MetaLeX OS and follow the steps.

<Callout>
  Actions available in MetaLeX OS change depending on the privileges of your connected wallet. The interface supports actions for both BORG members and DAO token holders.

## Basic workflow

1. **Connect your wallet** using the button in the upper-right corner of the app.
2. **Select the BORG** you want to interact with from the dashboard.
3. **Review your permissions** to see whether you can propose or approve transactions.
4. **Submit or confirm actions** directly in the interface. MetaLeX OS guides you through the required signatures or DAO votes.
5. **Track execution** in the activity feed to verify when transactions are finalized onchain.

For an overview of available BORG types, visit the [BORG Command Center](/os/borg/borg-landing).
