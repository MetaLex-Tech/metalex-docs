# Conditions

Conditions define checks that must pass before the BORG core will forward a transaction. They can inspect state, timestamps, or any other onchain data to ensure proposals comply with organizational rules.

Conditions often work in tandem with [implants](/os/borg/implants) to provide fine-grained control over what actions are allowed.
