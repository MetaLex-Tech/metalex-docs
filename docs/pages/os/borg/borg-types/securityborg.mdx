## security-BORGs

Security BORGs wrap emergency/security multisigs like 

<Callout>
One example is Curve's ['emergency DAO'](https://resources.curve.fi/governance/understanding-governance/#emergency-dao) (which we at MetaLeX would preferably refer to as an 'emergency BORG' instead).

With MetaLeX's modular design, grantBORGs can use any onchain Implant to add functionality to enhance or customize the BORG to your needs.
