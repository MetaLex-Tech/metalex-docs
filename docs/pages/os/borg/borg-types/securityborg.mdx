## securityBORGs / emergencyBORGS

Security BORGs wrap emergency/security multisigs to respond to critical events. They can be used to protect funds in a DAO, upgrade critical contracts or infrastructor for a protocol, or to manage a DAO's emergency response. securityBorgs not only provide much needed legal definition for signers and actions, but also providing a clear and transparent onchain processes for emergency actions and security procedures.

<Callout>
One example is Curve's ['emergency DAO'](https://resources.curve.fi/governance/understanding-governance/#emergency-dao) (which we at MetaLeX would preferably refer to as an 'emergency BORG' instead).
</Callout>

With MetaLeX's modular design, grantBORGs can use any onchain Implant to add functionality to enhance or customize the BORG to your needs.
