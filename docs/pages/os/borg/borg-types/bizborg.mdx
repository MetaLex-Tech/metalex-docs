# bizBORG

bizBORGs, also known as cyberCORPs, are onchain corporations that merge traditional legal structures with programmable smart contracts. By wrapping a multisig in a legal entity and enforcing policy onchain, they create governance‑accountable, trust‑minimized organizations that can operate and fund themselves directly on the blockchain.

## Overview

- Provide a cryptolegal framework for DAO‑adjacent or stand‑alone entities, separating real‑world corporate controls from digital execution.
- Built on MetaLeX's BORGs OS to automate compliance and corporate actions through audited modules and guards.
- Integrate with MetaLeX's cyberSAFE so companies can fundraise with regulation‑compliant SAFEs in just a few clicks.
- Serve as a "cybernetic entity hub," enabling programmable fundraising and tokenized securities that are auditable and enforceable onchain.
