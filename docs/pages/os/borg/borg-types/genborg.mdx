## genBORGs

genBORGs are generalBORGs, short for general purpose BORGs, that can be used for a wide variety of purposes. Handling Human-in-the-loop functionality for protocols, they can assist anywhere a DAO needs interaction with the physical or legal world.

With MetaLeX's modular design, grantBORGs can use any onchain Implant to add functionality to enhance or customize the BORG to your needs.
