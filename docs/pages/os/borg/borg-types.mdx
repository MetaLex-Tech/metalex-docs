# BORG Types

BORGs lend themselves to an almost infinite number of uses and configurations. Here we give a few examples. 

grants-BORGs
Grant BORGs are responsible for managing and distributing grants to projects, developers, and other initiatives that align with the goals and objectives of the associated DAO. These BORGs act as a bridge between the DAO and the wider ecosystem, identifying opportunities for investment and growth. They follow a transparent and accountable process for evaluating grant proposals, making funding decisions, and monitoring the progress of funded projects. By doing so, Grant BORGs help ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the DAO and its ecosystem. Grant BORGs likely require a greater amount of social versatility and cannot be constrained as much through on-chain logic, but, for example, there could be a rule that any single grant in excess of $250k of value requires the vote of both the management of the Grant BORG and a majority of the DAO–and this could be enforced through on-chain logic (e.g. if BORG holds funds in multisig, expenditures over $250k require multisig supermajority with DAO being one of the votes). Grant BORGs present particularly sensitive tax issues because they are, in effect, paying service providers (with potential to be responsible for tax withholding, tax reporting, social security contributions, VAT, etc.), and thus there might be a need for multiple Grant BORGs in different jurisdictions where grant recipients reside.

An example is the [Neutron Grants BORG](https://forum.neutron.org/t/approved-proposal-14-launching-the-neutron-grants-program/95).  

security-BORGs

Security BORGs wrap emergency/security multisigs like Curve's ['emergency DAO'](https://resources.curve.fi/governance/understanding-governance/#emergency-dao) (which we at MetaLeX would preferably refer to as an 'emergency BORG' instead). 

fin-BORGs or pbv-BORGs 
finBORGs run the 'finance operatioons' adjacent to a DAO or protocol. These include managing liquidity incentives like Lido's [LOL multisig](https://research.lido.fi/t/liquidity-observation-lab-lol-liquidity-strategy-and-application-to-curve-steth-eth-pool/5335/7), or arrangeements closer to OlympusDAO/DeFi 2.0 style 'protocol-owned liquidity' arrangements (which we at MetaleX instead refer to as 'protocol-beneficial value' when it is owned/managed by a BORG). 

alliiance-BORGs 
Alliance BORGs hold and manage token positions of aligned communities/strategic partners and manage those relationships. 

An example is the [Lido Alliance BORG](https://research.lido.fi/t/organize-the-lido-alliance-program-as-a-lido-dao-adjacent-borg/8173)

IP-BORGs
Intellectual Property (IP) BORGs manage and protect the intellectual property assets associated with a DAO, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. These BORGs work to ensure that the DAO’s IP is properly registered, maintained, and enforced, while also respecting the rights of others in the ecosystem. IP BORGs also play a crucial role in negotiating licensing agreements, partnerships, and other arrangements that involve the sharing or transfer of intellectual property rights. This helps to foster innovation, collaboration, and the responsible use of IP within the decentralized ecosystem.
