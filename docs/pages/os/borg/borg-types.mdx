# BORG Types

BORGs lend themselves to an almost infinite number of uses and configurations. Here we give a few examples.

fin-BORGs or pbv-BORGs
finBORGs run the 'finance operations' adjacent to a DAO or protocol. These include managing liquidity incentives like Lido's [LOL multisig](https://research.lido.fi/t/liquidity-observation-lab-lol-liquidity-strategy-and-application-to-curve-steth-eth-pool/5335/7), or arrangeements closer to OlympusDAO/DeFi 2.0 style 'protocol-owned liquidity' arrangements (which we at MetaleX instead refer to as 'protocol-beneficial value' when it is owned/managed by a BORG).

alliiance-BORGs
Alliance BORGs hold and manage token positions of aligned communities/strategic partners and manage those relationships.

An example is the [Lido Alliance BORG](https://research.lido.fi/t/organize-the-lido-alliance-program-as-a-lido-dao-adjacent-borg/8173)

IP-BORGs
Intellectual Property (IP) BORGs manage and protect the intellectual property assets associated with a DAO, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. These BORGs work to ensure that the DAOâ€™s IP is properly registered, maintained, and enforced, while also respecting the rights of others in the ecosystem. IP BORGs also play a crucial role in negotiating licensing agreements, partnerships, and other arrangements that involve the sharing or transfer of intellectual property rights. This helps to foster innovation, collaboration, and the responsible use of IP within the decentralized ecosystem.
