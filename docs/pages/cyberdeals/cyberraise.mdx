# ðŸš€ cyberRaise

**[cyberRaise](https://cybercorps.metalex.tech)** is MetaLeX Labsâ€™ compliant earlyâ€‘stage fundraising app. Built on top of the cyberCORPS OS and the cyberDeals stack, it lets founders propose, negotiate, and close venture deals entirely on-chain. It integrates modules like [LeXcheX](https://metalex-docs.vercel.app/cyberdeals/lexchex) for accredited-investor verification and [LeXscroW](https://metalex-docs.vercel.app/cyberdeals/lexscrow) for non-custodial escrow. SAFEs, token warrants, and hybrid agreements are executed through smart contracts, ensuring that capital moves only when all terms are satisfied.

## Key Contracts and Modules

Onchain deal flow in cyberCORP is enabled by several key smart contracts and modules:

* **`DealManager`**: Coordinates deals, tracking proposals, signatures, and finalization.
* **`CyberAgreementRegistry`**: Maintains standardized legal agreement templates (identified by `templateId`) and records executed deals via `agreementId`.
* **`IssuanceManager`**: Manages issuance of securities (NFT certificates or SAFE tokens).
* **`LexScroWLite`**: Manages escrow conditions, ensuring secure asset transfers only when conditions are fulfilled.
* **`LeXcheX`**: Verifies investor accreditation, often enforced as an escrow condition.
* **`TokenWarrantExtension`**: Enables hybrid deals, attaching rights for future tokens to equity NFTs.
* **`ICondition`**: Interface for custom deal conditions (e.g., time locks, KYC checks).

## Proposing a Deal

Founders propose deals via the cyberRaise app or directly by calling `DealManager`, selecting a template (`templateId`), specifying terms, and parties. `DealManager` assigns a unique `agreementId`. The founder cryptographically signs the deal (EIP-712 signature), marking it partially signed.

## Escrow Setup

The `DealManager` initiates a LexScroWLite escrow upon proposal, holding reserved equity NFTs (minted via `IssuanceManager`) pending investor participation.

## Investor Countersigning & Funding

Investors countersign via wallet, simultaneously funding the deal (e.g., using `safeTransferFrom` for ERC-20 tokens like USDC). Assets remain locked in escrow until finalization.

## Finalizing the Deal

Upon meeting conditions, escrow releases investor funds to the company's `companyPayable` address and equity NFTs to the investor. Events (e.g., `DealFinalized`) and on-chain logs record deal closure.

## Hybrid Deals and Token Warrants

Hybrid agreements (SAFE + token warrant) are handled via `TokenWarrantExtension`. Equity NFTs issued include token rights, bundled into a single deal managed seamlessly by the standard process.

## Deal Expiry and Additional Conditions

Deals have expiry deadlines, automatically voiding if unmet. Custom `ICondition` contracts enforce additional requirements (e.g., accreditation via LeXcheX, KYC compliance).

## Benefits of On-Chain Deal Flow

On-chain automation provides faster closings, cryptographic security, and transparent compliance without intermediaries. Founders and investors benefit from streamlined, trust-minimized processes where fundraising becomes programmable and secure.
