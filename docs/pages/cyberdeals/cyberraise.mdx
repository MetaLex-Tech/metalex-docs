# 🚀 cyberRaise

**cyberRaise** is MetaLeX Labs’ compliant early‑stage fundraising app. Built on top of the cyberCORPS OS and the cyberDeals stack, it lets founders propose, negotiate and close venture deals entirely onchain.

The application lives at [cybercorps.metalex.tech](https://cybercorps.metalex.tech/) and integrates modules like [LeXcheX](/cyberdeals/lexchex) for accredited‑investor verification and [LeXscroW](/cyberdeals/lexscrow) for non‑custodial escrow. SAFEs, token warrants and hybrid agreements are executed through smart contracts, ensuring that capital moves only when all terms are satisfied.

An early version of this concept was outlined in [MetaLeX’s “cybersafe” fundraising article](https://metalex.substack.com/p/metalexs-cybersafe-fund-your-company), and cyberRaise continues that vision toward a full‑featured, rule‑compliant VC platform.
