# cyberRaise: On‑Chain Fundraising Revolutionized

**cyberRaise** is MetaLeX Labs’ compliant, early‑stage fundraising dApp designed to transform how startups and investors engage in venture financing. Built atop the cyberCORPS operating system and the cyberDeals smart contract stack, cyberRaise makes the fundraising process fully transparent, programmable, and secure by leveraging blockchain technology. It empowers founders and investors to complete investment rounds without reliance on intermediaries or cumbersome paperwork, streamlining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Advanced modules like **LeXcheX** for on-chain investor accreditation and **LeXscroW** for automated escrow ensure that all deal conditions are met before capital moves, eliminating counterparty risk.

*The cyberRaise interface allows founders to choose from various deal types – classic SAFEs, SAFTs, SAFTEs, and hybrid SAFE + Token Warrant deals – under different regulatory exemptions (Reg D for U.S. offerings and Reg S for international offerings). Each option comes with standardized terms, enabling compliant fundraising in just a few clicks.* (In brief: **SAFE** for future equity, **SAFT** for future tokens, **SAFTE** combining equity and token rights, and **SAFE + Token Warrant** bundling an equity SAFE with a token option side letter, as explained below.)

## Key Smart Contracts and Modules

A number of smart contracts and modules underlie cyberRaise’s on-chain functionality, each handling a critical piece of the fundraising workflow:
* **RoundManager:** Coordinates multi-investor fundraising rounds. Founders call `createRound` to set parameters (series type, raise cap, min/max ticket, round type, payment token, price per unit, valuation, terms and template ID). The RoundManager deploys CyberCertPrinter contracts via the IssuanceManager for each security to be issued, stores the round parameters, and emits a `RoundCreated` event. It supports **two round types** – first‑come‑first‑served (FCFS) and founder‑approved – and manages expressions of interest (EOI), allocation, closing, and conversion of certificates when a qualifying event occurs.

* **DealManager:** Handles bespoke, single-counterparty deals. It manages deal proposal creation, tracks signatures, and triggers finalization when all conditions are met. DealManager remains available for one-off agreements, while RoundManager handles multi-investor rounds.

* **CyberAgreementRegistry:** A transparent registry of standardized and attorney-vetted legal agreement templates. Each template is identified by a unique `templateId` (e.g. SAFE, SAFT, SAFTE, etc.), and every executed deal instantiates a new agreement instance with its own `agreementId`. This ties each on-chain deal to a specific legal document (retrievable via an IPFS URI or hash of the contract text) while maintaining an immutable record of all executed agreements. The registry also keeps track of which parties have signed and whether an agreement is fully signed, voided, or finalized. It includes a built-in **delegation** system (described later) that allows one address to sign on behalf of another under certain conditions.

* **IssuanceManager:** Handles the compliant issuance of tokenized securities. When `createRound` is called, the RoundManager uses the IssuanceManager to deploy **CyberCertPrinter** contracts (ERC-721 NFT contracts) for each security type, and during allocation it mints non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that serve as digital security certificates representing instruments such as SAFEs, SAFTs, token warrants, or SAFTEs. These NFTs carry the key terms of the deal in their metadata and evidence the investor’s rights. They are initially **non-transferable** to comply with securities law, and the IssuanceManager allows the company to later toggle transferability or void the NFT if needed.

* **LeXscroWLite:** A lightweight escrow smart contract that securely holds assets during the deal process. The RoundManager relies on it to escrow investor funds and the company’s securities for each EOI, releasing assets only when predefined conditions (signatures, accreditation checks, deadlines, custom conditions) are satisfied. This guarantees an atomic swap: the startup’s NFT securities move to the investor only if the investor’s payment is received, and vice versa. If a round allocation expires or is voided, LeXscroWLite can refund funds and return certificates to unwind the transaction safely.

* **LeXcheX:** Automates investor compliance by integrating on-chain accreditation checks. LeXcheX is an NFT-based accreditation system: an investor completes a one-time KYC/verification process (off-chain) and is issued a **soul-bound** NFT certificate attesting to their accredited status. The cyberRaise platform can then verify an investor’s eligibility in a single contract call. For instance, before accepting an investor’s EOI, the RoundManager invokes a `LexChexCondition` that checks the investor’s address against the LeXcheX contract to confirm they hold a valid accreditation NFT. This fulfills requirements like SEC Rule 506(c) (verification of accredited investor status for public fundraising in the U.S.) without traditional paperwork. The accreditation NFT cannot be transferred and can carry an expiration date or metadata about the verification method, providing a robust on-chain record of compliance.

* **TokenWarrantExtension:** An extension module enabling hybrid deals that attach future token rights to equity raises. It supports structures like **SAFE + Token Warrant** deals, where an equity agreement (SAFE) is bundled with an option for the investor to receive tokens in the future. During `createRound`, the RoundManager deploys separate certificate printers for the SAFE and the warrant so that allocation mints the corresponding NFTs together. The TokenWarrantExtension handles additional parameters such as token warrant coverage, exercise price, and token release schedule. For example, it can enforce that if an investor wishes to exercise the warrant later to claim tokens, they must pay a predefined **exercise price** (which can be per token or a nominal amount) – whereas in a SAFTE (see below), the token rights come *without* an extra payment.

* **ICondition:** A flexible interface for plugging in bespoke compliance modules. Beyond standard checks (like accreditation and signatures), cyberRaise allows founders to attach custom smart contract conditions to each EOI. These could include additional KYC/AML verifications, time-based vesting or lock-up requirements, minimum or maximum raise thresholds, or essentially any boolean condition that can be codified in a smart contract. The RoundManager supports adding or removing such conditions, and during allocation it calls each condition’s `checkCondition` function to ensure it returns true. This modular approach means cyberRaise can accommodate project-specific covenants and evolving regulatory requirements without altering its core logic.


## Streamlined On-Chain Fundraising Process

With the RoundManager, cyberRaise structures fundraising into a round lifecycle that automates capital flow and securities issuance:

1. **Round creation:** The founder uses the cyberRaise dashboard to start a raise, selecting the round type, series, and ticket sizes. They set parameters (series type, raise cap, min/max ticket, round type, payment token, price per unit, valuation, terms and template ID) and call `createRound`. The RoundManager deploys one or more `CyberCertPrinter` contracts via the `IssuanceManager` for each security to be issued, stores the parameters in the `Round` struct, and emits a `RoundCreated` event.

2. **Expressions of Interest (EOI):** Investors join the round by calling `submitEOI` with their desired amount. The RoundManager checks the round’s status, uses `CyberAgreementRegistry` to create an agreement instance, sets up escrow via `LeXscroWLite`, and attaches any per‑EOI conditions (e.g. `LexChexCondition`) to enforce compliance.

3. **Allocation & funding:** For `FCFS` rounds, allocation happens automatically when an EOI is submitted. For `FounderApproved` rounds, the founder reviews EOIs and calls `allocate` on those they accept. During allocation the system signs the agreement, computes units, mints certificates through `IssuanceManager`, attaches endorsements, refunds any surplus funds, finalizes the escrow, and updates the amount raised. Allocation mints **non‑transferable NFT certificates** representing securities (e.g., SAFE tokens, SAFT tokens, or hybrid instruments), demonstrating how capital flows and securities issuance are automated in CorpFi.

4. **Closing & conversion:** A round closes when the raise cap is met or the end time passes, preventing new EOIs. For convertible instruments (SAFE, SAFT, SAFTE), the RoundManager provides functions to convert certificates into equity or tokens when a qualifying event such as a priced equity round or token generation event occurs. Conversions call `IssuanceManager` to mint new equity shares to SAFE holders or distribute tokens to SAFT holders, using valuation caps and discounts encoded in the certificates.

For bespoke single‑investor deals, the legacy DealManager flow (proposal → escrow → countersign & fund → finalize) remains available and will be documented separately, but RoundManager is the recommended path for multi‑investor raises.

### Round Types and Compliance Modules

`RoundType` values determine how EOIs are handled:

* **FCFS:** allocations occur automatically on a first‑come basis.
* **FounderApproved:** the company reviews each EOI and explicitly allocates.

`RoundingPolicy` handles the rounding of fractional units when converting amounts into securities.

Compliance modules are attached per EOI. `LeXcheX` accreditation checks, `LexChexCondition`, and other `ICondition` modules can restrict participation based on jurisdictional or project-specific requirements.

### Compliance & Transfer Restrictions

After certificates are minted, their transferability is controlled by on-chain hooks:

* **WhitelistTransferHook** requires both sender and receiver to be approved before a certificate can move.
* **ToggleTransferHook** allows the company to toggle transferability globally or for a specific certificate ID.

These hooks, combined with modules like `LeXcheX`, ensure that securities cannot be transferred to non‑qualified buyers even after the raise, keeping CorpFi operations compliant.

### Hybrid Instruments and Conversions

Each instrument in a round corresponds to a distinct certificate printer created during `createRound`, and certificates are minted upon allocation. For example, a **SAFE + Token Warrant** round causes the RoundManager to create two printers so allocation mints two NFTs – one for the SAFE and another for the warrant. SAFT certificates convert to tokens when the network launches, while SAFTEs or token warrants can convert to both equity and tokens via the RoundManager’s conversion function. This demonstrates how capital flows and securities issuance are automated in CorpFi.

**Delegated Signing Authority:** cyberRaise also provides flexibility for real-world corporate workflows through a delegation feature. In many startups, the person who controls the funds (e.g. a multi-signature corporate wallet) may not be the one actually executing documents day-to-day. To accommodate this, cyberRaise allows a founder or authorized company officer to **delegate signing authority** to another EVM address on-chain. In practice, one wallet (for example, the founder’s personal wallet) can be authorized to propose and sign deals on behalf of another address (for example, the company’s official treasury wallet or a multi-sig). This means a company can keep its funds and issued securities in a secure custody account, while a delegate (with a separate key) handles the interactions and approvals on cyberRaise. The delegation is established by an on-chain setting in the CyberAgreementRegistry – essentially, the company’s address appoints a delegate address and an optional expiry time for that delegation. Once in place, whenever the delegate signs an agreement, the platform recognizes it as if the company itself signed (the signature verification logic checks the delegation mapping to validate this). Only the specific delegate designated (and only within the time window, if an expiry was set) can act for the delegator, ensuring security. This feature streamlines the process for teams using multi-sig treasuries or hardware vaults: the founder can initiate and close deals with their own key, while funds flow in and out of the multi-sig as intended and the NFTs are ultimately held by the multi-sig or corporate entity. In short, founders can confidently conduct raises through their convenient hot wallet or executive account, while still having the final assets (investor funds and security NFTs) end up in the proper company-controlled wallets. The on-chain audit trail will show that the company was the party to the agreement, with the delegate’s signature approved via the delegation mechanism, preserving legal clarity about who the actual issuer and counterparty are.

## Benefits of an On-Chain Deal Flow

By turning the entire fundraising pipeline into code, cyberRaise delivers significant advantages over traditional methods:

* **Speed and Efficiency:** Deals that might take weeks or months to coordinate can now close in minutes once terms are agreed. Execution is automatic upon conditions being met – no waiting for wire transfers, coordinating schedules for signings, or couriering documents for signatures. This rapid closing means startups can secure funding faster and start deploying capital immediately. Observers note that MetaLeX’s approach *“streamlines startup fundraising by automating the SAFE process on-chain, reducing legal fees”* – time saved is money saved.

* **Cost Reduction:** The automation of legal agreements and elimination of third-party intermediaries (like escrow agents or excessive legal oversight) cuts down on transaction friction and expenses. Founders spend far less on attorney hours and administrative costs, since the smart contracts enforce the terms automatically. Standardized on-chain templates mean that in many cases, bespoke document drafting is minimized, further reducing legal overhead.

* **Trust Minimization:** All participants can trust the **code** rather than each other. The rules of the deal are enforced by smart contracts, removing the need to rely on a counterparty’s promise. Funds aren’t released until conditions are verified on-chain, and signatures are cryptographically secured and validated. Investors gain confidence that their money will only be released if they indeed receive the agreed-upon securities, and founders are assured that investor funds are locked in escrow once the deal is signed. This cryptographic certainty eliminates the risk of either party backing out after the other has performed, effectively neutralizing counterparty risk.

* **Transparency and Immutable Records:** Every action in a cyberRaise deal – proposal creation, each party’s signature with timestamp, fund deposits, and final distributions – is recorded on the blockchain. This provides an immutable audit trail for regulators, auditors, or future investors. Anyone can independently verify what happened, when it happened, and the exact terms of the deal (since the template ID and key parameters are on-chain in the CyberAgreementRegistry). The cap table updates in real-time on-chain: an investor’s rights are evidenced by an NFT in their wallet, and that record cannot be tampered with or hidden. This level of transparency and certainty is unprecedented in traditional fundraising, where much is done on faith and paper. With cyberRaise, disputes over “who owns what” or whether funds were sent are virtually eliminated by the public ledger.

* **Global Accessibility with Built-In Compliance:** Because deals are conducted via Web3 wallets and smart contracts, cyberRaise opens up participation to global investors (with the necessary compliance checks baked in). Projects can broadly solicit interest (even via Twitter or community forums) and let the platform handle accreditation checks and regional restrictions. Modules like LeXcheX make it possible to publicly advertise a raise under Rule 506(c) and still restrict actual investment to verified accredited investors in the U.S., while also accommodating non-U.S. investors under Reg S. This expands the pool of capital for startups without sacrificing legal compliance, since the smart contracts rigorously enforce the rules on who can invest and automatically include the proper legend and transfer restrictions on the issued securities. A founder in Singapore could raise from investors in the U.S. and Europe seamlessly on the same platform, with each investor’s credentials verified on-chain and the appropriate legal framework (Reg D, Reg S, etc.) automatically applied based on template selection.

* **Innovative Deal Possibilities:** The composable nature of cyberRaise’s contracts means new financing structures can be created or combined easily. Founders are not limited to vanilla SAFE terms – they can offer creative deal sweeteners like token warrants, revenue-sharing conditions, tiered conversions, or other novel mechanisms, and trust the platform to handle the complexity. For instance, cyberRaise supports SAFTEs (which give investors equity plus token rights) and other hybrids that align with Web3 projects’ unique needs. Because these features are modular, MetaLeX can introduce new templates or extensions (for example, for convertible notes, revenue loans, or NFT-based crowdfunding agreements) that plug into the same DealManager and escrow framework. All of this is accomplished in one unified workflow that keeps things simple for users despite the sophisticated outcomes. This flexibility to tailor deals, combined with automation, is paving the way for venture financing that is both innovative and compliant by design.

In sum, cyberRaise transforms fundraising into a faster, safer, and more transparent endeavor. Founders benefit from quick, automated deal execution and reduced overhead, while investors gain reassurance through built-in compliance checks and cryptographic security. The days of shuffling PDFs, coordinating endless emails, and relying on trust are replaced by smart contracts and NFTs that **encapsulate the deal**. Ultimately, cyberRaise doesn’t just make fundraising *simpler* — it makes it fundamentally more **programmatic and secure**. It paves the way for a future where startups can raise capital as easily as sending a transaction, with every legal and financial requirement handled by code. This is venture financing reimagined for the blockchain era, turning the vision of fully on-chain startups (or **cyberCORPs**) into a reality today.

**Sources:** The details above are grounded in the cyberRaise app and codebase – notably the MetaLeX Tech **cybercorps-contracts** repository (which implements the DealManager, CyberAgreementRegistry, LeXcheX, etc.) and the live cyberRaise interface. The platform’s supported deal types and compliance features are backed by the smart contracts (see **SecurityClass** enums for SAFE, SAFT, SAFTE, etc., and condition checks for accreditation), ensuring that this launch is fully supported by on-chain functionality and not just aspirational marketing.
