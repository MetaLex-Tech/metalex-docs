# cyberRaise: On‑Chain Fundraising Revolutionized

cyberRaise is MetaLeX Labs’ compliant, early‑stage fundraising dApp designed to revolutionize how startups and investors engage in venture financing. Built atop the cyberCORPS operating system and the cyberDeals smart contract stack, cyberRaise makes the fundraising process fully transparent, programmable, and secure by leveraging blockchain technology. It empowers founders and investors to complete investment rounds without reliance on intermediaries or cumbersome paperwork, streamlining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Advanced modules like **LeXcheX** for on-chain investor accreditation and **LeXscroW** for automated escrow ensure that all deal conditions are met before capital moves, eliminating counterparty risk.

&#x20;*The cyberRaise interface allows founders to choose from various deal types – classic SAFEs, SAFTs, SAFTEs, and hybrid SAFE+Token Warrant deals – under different regulatory exemptions (Reg D for U.S. offerings and Reg S for international offerings). Each option comes with standardized terms, enabling compliant fundraising in just a few clicks.*

## Key Smart Contracts and Modules

A number of smart contracts and modules underlie cyberRaise’s on-chain functionality, each handling a critical piece of the fundraising workflow:

* **DealManager:** The on-chain deal orchestrator that coordinates each raise from inception to completion. It manages proposal creation, tracks signatures, and triggers finalization of a deal’s lifecycle in a secure, auditable manner.
* **CyberAgreementRegistry:** A transparent registry of standardized and attorney-vetted legal agreement templates. Each template is identified by a `templateId` (e.g. SAFE, SAFT, etc.), and every executed deal instantiates a new agreement instance with a unique `agreementId`. This ensures each on-chain deal is tied to a specific legal text while maintaining an immutable record of all executed agreements.
* **IssuanceManager:** Handles the compliant issuance of tokenized securities. It mints non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that serve as digital security certificates representing the investment instruments (such as a SAFE or a token warrant). These NFTs carry the terms of the deal and are used to evidence the investor’s rights (equity, future tokens, etc.) in a programmable form.
* **LeXscroWLite:** A lightweight escrow smart contract that securely holds assets (investor funds and the issued NFT securities) until all predefined conditions of the deal are satisfied. It ensures that *no* funds or tokens change hands prematurely – only when every condition (signatures, accreditation checks, deadlines, etc.) is met will the escrow release assets to their rightful recipients.
* **LeXcheX:** Automates investor compliance by integrating on-chain accreditation checks. LeXcheX allows an investor to complete a one-time verification and receive a **soul-bound** NFT certificate proving accredited status. The cyberRaise platform uses this to verify investor eligibility with a single contract call, fulfilling requirements like SEC Rule 506(c) without traditional paperwork. This innovation lets companies raise publicly while remaining compliant, effectively letting on-chain code **“skip the paper”** in verifying investor qualifications.
* **TokenWarrantExtension:** An extension module enabling hybrid deals that attach future token rights to equity raises. It supports structures like **SAFE + Token Warrant** deals, where an equity agreement is bundled with an option for tokens down the line (a structure increasingly favored by top-tier crypto VCs like Andreessen Horowitz). This module automates the issuance of the token warrant alongside the SAFE, so that complex multi-faceted deals can be executed in one go.
* **ICondition:** A flexible interface for plugging in bespoke deal conditions. This could include additional requirements such as KYC/AML verification, time-based locks, minimum raise thresholds, or any event-driven condition that must be fulfilled before a deal completes. By modularizing conditions, cyberRaise can accommodate custom clauses and regulatory checks without modifying the core contracts.

## Streamlined On-Chain Fundraising Process

With cyberRaise, the entire fundraising transaction is handled on-chain in a few seamless steps. Founders and investors interact through a simple interface (or directly with the contracts), and once terms are agreed and conditions met, funds and tokens are exchanged atomically. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Proposing a Deal:** The founder initiates a fundraising round via the intuitive cyberRaise dashboard (or by calling the `DealManager` contract directly). They select a standardized agreement template (e.g. SAFE, SAFT, SAFTE, etc.), input deal parameters like valuation cap, token warrant coverage or conversion terms (if applicable), and then cryptographically sign the proposal (using an EIP-712 compliant signature). This on-chain proposal contains the key terms and the founder’s commitment, and it is recorded by the DealManager under a unique deal ID.

2. **Escrow Setup:** As soon as a deal is proposed, the platform automatically sets up the escrow conditions. The DealManager works with **LeXscroWLite** to create an escrow for the deal, and the **IssuanceManager** mints the NFT securities representing the investment instrument. For example, if it’s a SAFE or SAFTE, an NFT certificate for the convertible security is created; if a token warrant is involved, a corresponding NFT for the warrant may also be minted. These NFT certificates are held in the escrow contract (not delivered to the founder or investor yet), effectively “locking” the deal’s terms on-chain and awaiting counterparty action.

3. **Investor Countersigning & Funding:** The investor can review the deal terms (the legal agreement text is accessible via the CyberAgreementRegistry for full transparency) and countersign the agreement through their Web3 wallet, indicating acceptance. At the same time, the investor transfers the investment funds (e.g. USDC or ETH) into the escrow by calling a function like `safeTransferFrom` to the LeXscroW contract. Before an investor’s signature and funds are accepted, cyberRaise will automatically enforce compliance checks – for instance, verifying the investor’s **LeXcheX accreditation NFT** to ensure they are authorized to invest. All these actions (signature validation and fund deposit) occur as one atomic on-chain transaction, so the investor’s money is escrowed only if their signature is valid and compliance conditions pass.

4. **Finalizing the Deal:** Once the required parties have signed and the funds are in escrow, the platform automatically validates that *all* deal conditions are satisfied. This includes ensuring signatures from both sides, verifying any custom ICondition modules (e.g. KYC/AML checks or other covenants), and confirming that the closing deadline has not passed. Upon successful validation, the **LeXscroW** escrow releases the assets atomically: the invested funds are transferred directly to the startup’s designated treasury address (e.g. the company’s wallet), and simultaneously the NFT security (or securities) are delivered to the investor’s wallet. Because this final step is orchestrated by smart contracts, the “closing” of the deal happens instantly on-chain – there is no settlement delay. Both parties end up with what they bargained for (company gets the capital, investor holds the on-chain security) in one transaction, with an immutable public record of the outcome.

**Hybrid Deals and Token Warrants:** cyberRaise seamlessly supports complex hybrid arrangements without adding friction to the process. For instance, in a **SAFE + Token Warrant** round, the founder’s single proposal can bundle both an equity SAFE and a token warrant for a future token drop. The investor’s single countersignature and payment likewise covers both instruments. Behind the scenes, the TokenWarrantExtension works with the IssuanceManager to mint multiple NFTs as needed – for example, an investor might receive two NFT certificates (one representing the SAFE equity contract and another representing the token warrant rights) upon closing. Despite involving multiple instruments, the platform treats the bundle as one cohesive deal: everything is signed, funded, and finalized in one workflow. This not only simplifies what traditionally required separate agreements and steps, but also provides investors a clear, tokenized record of each component of their investment. Notably, offering equity with optional token upside in this manner has become a popular approach in Web3 fundraising (a method **favored by firms like a16z**), and cyberRaise makes executing such deals as straightforward as a standard SAFE.

**Deal Expiry and Custom Conditions:** To ensure fairness and clarity in every raise, cyberRaise enforces explicit deal expiration and supports additional custom conditions. Founders can specify an expiration time or date for the deal; if the investor hasn’t countersigned and funded by the deadline, the deal is automatically voided on-chain (any escrowed assets are returned to their senders), preventing open-ended commitments. Furthermore, thanks to the ICondition interface, founders can require bespoke conditions that must be met before closing. This can include mandatory KYC/AML verifications, minimum or maximum raise amounts, or any other project-specific covenant. For example, a deal could be set such that *only* investors holding a certain verifiable credential (like a specific LeXcheX accreditation level or a DAO membership NFT) can participate – the smart contract will check for that condition and only finalize if it’s fulfilled. These programmable conditions ensure that even nuanced legal or regulatory requirements can be enforced by code. The flexibility of ICondition means cyberRaise can adapt to various jurisdictions and deal structures while still benefiting from on-chain automation.

**Delegated Signing Authority:** cyberRaise also provides flexibility for real-world corporate workflows through a delegation feature. A founder or authorized company agent can delegate signing authority such that one wallet (for example, the founder’s personal wallet) is permitted to propose and execute deals on behalf of another address (for example, the company’s official treasury or multi-signature wallet). This means a company can keep its funds and issued securities in a secure custody wallet (or multisig), while a delegate (with a separate key) handles the interactions and signatures on cyberRaise. The delegation is established on-chain (e.g. via a special delegation contract or setting on the platform) and is fully permissioned, so only designated delegates can act for a given company. This feature streamlines the process for teams who use dedicated custody wallets, ensuring they don’t have to directly connect those wallets to sign transactions. Instead, founders can confidently conduct raises through their own keys while still having final assets (funds and NFTs) end up in the proper company wallets.

## Benefits of an On-Chain Deal Flow

By turning the entire fundraising pipeline into code, cyberRaise delivers significant advantages over traditional methods:

* **Speed and Efficiency:** Deals that might take weeks or months to coordinate can now close in minutes once terms are agreed. Execution is automatic upon conditions being met – no waiting for wire transfers or manual signatures. This rapid closing means startups can secure funding faster and start deploying capital immediately. Observers note that MetaLeX’s approach *“streamlines startup fundraising by automating the SAFE process onchain, reducing legal fees”* – time saved is money saved.
* **Cost Reduction:** The automation of legal agreements and elimination of third-party intermediaries (like escrow agents or excessive legal oversight) cuts down on transactional friction and expenses. Founders spend far less on attorney hours and administrative costs, since the smart contracts enforce the terms. Standardized on-chain templates also reduce the need for bespoke drafting in many cases.
* **Trust Minimization:** All participants can trust the code rather than each other. Funds aren’t released until conditions are verified, and signatures are cryptographically secured. Investors gain confidence that their money will only move if they indeed get the agreed securities, and founders are assured that investor funds are locked in once a deal is signed. This cryptographic certainty removes the risk of *either* party defaulting after the other has performed.
* **Transparency and Immutable Records:** Every action in a cyberRaise deal – proposals, signatures, fund deposits, and final distributions – is recorded on the blockchain. This audit trail provides unparalleled transparency. Investors, regulators, or auditors can independently verify what happened, when it happened, and the exact terms of the deal (via the hash of the agreement or template ID in the CyberAgreementRegistry). The immutability of blockchain records means there’s no dispute about cap tables or ownership: an investor’s rights are evidenced by an NFT in their wallet, and that record cannot be tampered with.
* **Global Accessibility with Compliance Built-In:** Because deals are conducted via Web3 wallets, cyberRaise opens up participation to global investors (subject to compliance checks). By leveraging modules like LeXcheX for on-chain accreditation, the platform makes it feasible to solicit investments more broadly (even publicly under Rule 506(c) in the U.S.) while automatically filtering for eligible investors. This expands the pool of capital for startups but *without* sacrificing legal compliance, since the smart contracts rigorously enforce the rules.
* **Innovative Deal Possibilities:** The composable nature of cyberRaise’s contracts means new financing structures can be created or combined easily. Founders can offer creative deal sweeteners (like token warrants, revenue share conditions, etc.) and trust the platform to handle the complexity. The support for SAFTEs (convertible to equity or tokens) and other hybrids is paving the way for venture financing that aligns with Web3 projects’ unique needs. All of this is done in one unified workflow that keeps things simple for the users despite the sophisticated outcomes.

In sum, cyberRaise transforms fundraising into a faster, safer, and more transparent endeavor. Founders benefit from quick deal execution and reduced overhead, while investors gain reassurance through automated compliance checks and cryptographic security. The days of shuffling PDFs and relying on trust are replaced by smart contracts and NFTs that encapsulate the deal. Ultimately, cyberRaise doesn’t just make fundraising *simpler* — it makes it fundamentally more **programmatic and secure**. It paves the way for a future where startups raise capital as easily as issuing a transaction, with the full confidence that every legal and financial requirement is handled by code. This is venture financing reimagined for the blockchain era, and it’s already turning the vision of fully on-chain startups (cyberCORPs) into a reality.
