# Round Manager

The `RoundManager` contract drives the lifecycle of fundraising rounds in the cyberDeals stack. It stores round metadata, tracks expressions of interest (EOIs), and exposes functions that move a raise from creation through conversion. For an overview of how these rounds surface in the app, see [cyberRaise](/cyberdeals/cyberraise).

## Round Lifecycle

- **createRound** – founder opens a round with parameters such as allocation size, deal template, and whether the round is first‑come‑first‑served (FCFS) or requires explicit approval.
- **submitEOI** – investors signal interest in the round by submitting an EOI indicating how much they want to commit.
- **allocate** – an authorized role accepts an EOI and reserves allocation for that investor.
- **reject** – an EOI can be rejected, keeping the round open for other participants.
- **closeRound** – ends the round and prevents new EOIs or allocations.
- **convert** – after a successful close, accepted EOIs are converted into on‑chain agreements and the corresponding security NFTs are minted.

## Data Structures

`Round` records the core details of a raise: creator, total allocation, template reference, whether it is FCFS, and if issued securities are currently transferable.

`EOI` (expression of interest) captures an investor’s requested allocation, wallet address, and current status (pending, accepted, or rejected).

## FCFS vs Founder‑Approved Rounds

FCFS rounds automatically allocate to the first valid EOIs until the allocation is exhausted. Founder‑approved rounds queue EOIs and require an authorized BorgAuth role to call `allocate` or `reject` before funds can move. This allows the company to vet investors while still managing the process on‑chain.

BorgAuth roles therefore determine who can advance the round lifecycle, accept or reject EOIs, and toggle transferability or other restrictions.
