# BORGCORE Modes

The borgCore is the central hub for on-chain BORGs. Its main purpose is to define the policy that governs which actions BORG members may take on chain. It extends the Gnosis Safe guard functionality.

<CardGrid>

**There are 3 types of BORG modes:**
    <Card
      title="Whitelist"
      link="/os/borg/borg-implants/borg-implant"
    >
      <span>
        Only approved addresses or calldata may execute transactions.
      </span>
    </Card>
      <Card
      title="Blacklist"
      link="/os/borg/borg-implants/borg-implant"
    >
      <span>
        Transactions from listed addresses or calldata are blocked.
      </span>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Unrestricted" link="/os/borg/borg-implants/borg-implant">
      <span>
        No allow or deny lists are enforced by the core.
      </span>
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Whitelist

- All transactions are blocked unless explicitly pre‑approved.
- Only designated recipients can receive native token transfers, each with optional per‑tx limits.
- Calls are limited to whitelisted contracts and methods, with parameter constraints such as type, ranges or exact values.
- Best for highly conservative BORGs holding significant value, like finBORGs or tightly controlled grants programs.

### Blacklist

- Transactions are permitted by default except those explicitly denied.
- Addresses on the blacklist cannot receive transfers.
- Contract calls or specific methods may be blocked unless parameters satisfy defined constraints.
- Useful for trusted teams needing broad discretion while avoiding a short list of risky actions.

### Unrestricted

- No allow or deny lists are enforced.
- Intended for BORGs where signers have full discretion but still want access to implants or MetaLeX tooling.

Both whitelist and blacklist modes can enforce cooldown periods on certain calls to prevent spammy proposals or denial‑of‑service patterns.
