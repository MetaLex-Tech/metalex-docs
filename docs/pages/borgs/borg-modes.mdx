# BORGCORE Modes

The borgCore is the central hub for on-chain BORGs. Its main purpose is to define the policy that governs which actions BORG members may take on chain. It extends the Gnosis Safe guard functionality.

<CardGrid>

**There are 3 types of BORG modes:**
    <Card
      title="Whitelist"
      link="/os/borg/borg-implants/borg-implant"
    >
      <span>
        Only approved addresses or calldata may execute transactions.
      </span>
    </Card>
      <Card
      title="Blacklist"
      link="/os/borg/borg-implants/borg-implant"
    >
      <span>
        Transactions from listed addresses or calldata are blocked.
      </span>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Unrestricted" link="/os/borg/borg-implants/borg-implant">
      <span>
        No allow or deny lists are enforced by the core.
      </span>
    </Card>
  </CardGrid>
