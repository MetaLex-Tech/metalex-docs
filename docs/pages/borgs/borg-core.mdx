# BORG Core

[`borg-core`](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/borg-core) is the on-chain policy engine that powers MetaLeX BORGs. It extends the Gnosis Safe guard and enforces which actions members may execute.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/borg-core
cd borg-core
npm install
npm run build
```

The contracts can then be deployed with your preferred tooling.

## Next Steps

Learn about [BORG modes](/borgs/borg-modes), [conditions](/borgs/conditions), and [implants](/borgs/implants) to customize how your organization operates.
