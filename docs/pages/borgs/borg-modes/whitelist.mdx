# Whitelist Mode

Only pre‑approved addresses or calldata may execute transactions through the BORG core.

- Native token transfers must target whitelisted recipients and may include per‑tx limits.
- Contract calls are restricted to allowed methods with optional parameter constraints.
- Best for high‑value treasuries or tightly controlled grants programs.
