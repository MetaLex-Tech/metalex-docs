# Whitelist Mode
- All transactions are blocked unless explicitly pre‑approved.
- Native token transfers must target whitelisted recipients and may include per‑tx limits.
- Calls are limited to whitelisted contracts and methods, with parameter constraints such as type, ranges or exact values.
- Best for highly conservative BORGs holding significant value, like finBORGs or tightly controlled grants programs.
