# Blacklist Mode

The BORG core permits all actions except those explicitly denied.

- Transfers to addresses on the blacklist are rejected.
- Calls to disallowed contracts or methods fail unless parameters pass defined checks.
- Useful for trusted operators who need flexibility while blocking known risks.
