# DAO Vote Grant

This implant requires a proposal to pass a DAO token holder vote before funds are released through the BORG core.

- A grant proposal is created in the governance system and linked to the implant.
- After the voting period, if the proposal meets quorum and approval thresholds, the BORG core is authorized to disburse funds.
- Proposals that fail or expire never reach execution, keeping the treasury under community control.
