# Eject

Provides a mechanism to remove a member or module from the BORG when predefined conditions are met.

It can:

- Allow a signer to voluntarily resign, triggering key rotation.
- Enable the DAO to force-remove compromised or inactive participants.
- Revoke modules that no longer meet governance standards.

The eject implant helps keep the BORG membership and connected contracts healthy over time.
