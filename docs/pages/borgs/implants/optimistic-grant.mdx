# Optimistic Grant

Grants are automatically approved after a waiting period unless vetoed by the DAO.

- Small grant requests can be executed quickly while still allowing token holders time to react.
- Any participant may submit a veto transaction during the cooldown to block the payout.
- If the window passes without objection, the grant executes from the BORG core.

Optimistic grants speed up routine disbursements without sacrificing accountability.
