# DAO Veto Grant

Queues grant transactions and lets the DAO cancel them during a defined veto window before automatic execution by the BORG core.

- When a grant is proposed, the implant places it in a timelock.
- Token holders or guardians may submit a veto while the timelock is active.
- If no veto arrives before the window closes, the grant executes through the BORG core.

The veto window provides a final safeguard without slowing routine approvals.
