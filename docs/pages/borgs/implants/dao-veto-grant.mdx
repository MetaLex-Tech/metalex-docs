# DAO Veto Grant

Grants are queued for execution but may be cancelled by a DAO veto within a set period.

- After a grant transaction is proposed, it enters a timelock managed by the implant.
- Token holders or guardians can submit a veto during the delay.
- If the veto window closes without action, the queued grant executes automatically from the BORG core.

This pattern balances fast grant approval with a lastâ€‘resort safety valve controlled by the broader DAO.
