# Conditions

Conditions define checks that must pass before the BORG core will forward a transaction. They can inspect state, timestamps, or any other on-chain data to ensure proposals comply with organizational rules.

Conditions often work in tandem with [implants](/borgs/implants) to provide fine-grained control over what actions are allowed.
