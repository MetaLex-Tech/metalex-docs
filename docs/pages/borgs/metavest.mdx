# MetaVesT

MetaVesT is a BORG‑compatible vesting and token lockup protocol for ERC20 tokens. It supports sophisticated grant structures that mirror real‑world legal agreements while remaining trust‑minimized.

## Key Capabilities

- **Dual curves** – tokens can "vest" and "unlock" on independent schedules with optional cliffs.
- **Options and restricted awards** – configure exercise or repurchase prices in stablecoins for tax‑optimized token grants.
- **Group amendments** – a majority‑in‑value of grantees plus the grantor can update terms for an entire cohort.
- **Can't‑be‑evil guarantees** – unless an amendment is approved, vested tokens cannot be clawed back and only vesting can be terminated.
- **Pass‑through voting** – unvested or locked tokens may still be staked and voted in a DAO.
- **Milestones** – vesting can depend on discrete events as well as elapsed time.

## Uses

MetaVesT can manage compensation for BORG personnel or govern how GrantsBORGs release tokens to recipients. It can also be paired with LeXscroW for escrowed token deals or with implants that respond to DAO approvals.
