# Implants

Implants are plug-in modules for the BORG core. They extend functionality by adding extra checks or execution steps before a transaction is approved.

Common implants include token gating, delay modules, and DAO-based veto mechanisms. Each implant can evaluate [conditions](/borgs/conditions) to tailor policy.
