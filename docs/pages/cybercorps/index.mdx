# üè¢ cyberCORPs

cyberCORPs fuse traditional corporate structures with programmable smart contracts, bringing the benefits of blockchain automation to familiar legal entities. In MetaLeX‚Äôs ecosystem, a [BORG (cybernetic organization)](/borg/what-is-a-BORG) is a legally-wrapped DAO or entity governed by code-infused rules. A cyberCORP differs in that it starts as a traditional corporation (e.g. a Delaware C-Corp or LLC) but operates on-chain: its equity is tokenized, and its key agreements and governance processes run via smart contracts. (In essence, cyberCORPs were originally conceived as ‚ÄúbizBORGs,‚Äù a business-focused subset of BORGs [MetaLeX Substack](https://metalex.substack.com).) While BORGs emphasize fully automated decentralized governance, cyberCORPs intersect with that framework by using BORG technology (such as on-chain role management) for a more centralized yet code-assisted corporation. This broadened focus targets startup founders and mainstream businesses ‚Äì MetaLeX‚Äôs cyberCORPs tech has a distinct roadmap and a broader audience beyond crypto DAOs [X](https://x.com).
