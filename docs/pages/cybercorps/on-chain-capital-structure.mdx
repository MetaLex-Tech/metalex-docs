# On‑Chain Capital Structure

A cyberCORP’s capital structure – its stock ledger and equity issuance – is managed entirely on-chain through smart contracts. The core components are the IssuanceManager and one or more CyberCertPrinter contracts, which together create and manage tokenized stock certificates. When a cyberCORP is initialized, it deploys an IssuanceManager contract dedicated to that company. This IssuanceManager functions like an on-chain registrar of the company’s shares and convertible securities. It can deploy new CyberCertPrinter contracts for each class or series of security the company has. For example, a corporation might have Class A Common Stock, Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred, etc. – each of these can correspond to a separate CyberCertPrinter (an ERC-721 token contract) that mints NFTs representing the shares of that class/series. Each CyberCertPrinter is essentially a digital stock certificate printer. Under the hood, it’s an upgradeable ERC-721 contract configured with a specific security type (e.g. “Common” or “Preferred”) and series (e.g. “Series A”) when created. The tokens it issues are stock certificates tokenized as NFTs, complete with metadata like the shareholder’s name or a link to the legal certificate document. MetaLeX’s research advocates this “tokenized stock certificate” approach, where blockchain tokens are imbued with the legal status and function of traditional paper stock certificates. This approach aligns with recent Delaware law amendments that explicitly allow corporations to maintain their stock ledger on a blockchain. By mapping each share (or each certificate representing some number of shares) to a unique token ID, the cyberCORP ensures that ownership of the company’s stock can be tracked and transferred on-chain with the same authority as an old-fashioned ledger entry – only now transfers can settle instantly with cryptographic signatures. The IssuanceManager and CyberCertPrinters work in tandem to handle corporate actions. For instance, if the company issues new shares or needs to record a SAFE conversion into equity, the IssuanceManager will call on the appropriate CyberCertPrinter to mint new stock tokens to the rightful owner (and record any relevant details like the investment amount or valuation cap used). Each token is effectively a certificated share – and because it’s on-chain, it can carry programmable features. The system supports distinguishing different share classes (common vs. preferred) and series (e.g. Series A, Series B) at the smart contract level, which is critical for enforcing things like preferences and voting rights. The security class and series mapping in the contracts ties into legal definitions discussed in MetaLeX’s “Tokenizing Corporate Capital Stock” research – for example, ensuring that a “Series A Preferred” token is recognized as such and can have its own transfer restrictions or legends as required GitHub. Notably, the CyberCertPrinter contracts can enforce transfer restrictions and legends to maintain compliance. In traditional corp law, transferring stock often requires either board approval or certain legends (e.g. “restricted security – not registered under Securities Act”) on certificates. The on-chain certificates mirror this: transfers can be globally restricted or require an endorsement. By default, a cyberCORP’s share tokens are not freely transferable without approval – the contract can require an on-chain endorsement (analogous to signing the back of a paper certificate) before a transfer to a new owner is completed. This ensures the cap table integrity is preserved and that transfers obey any legal or company policy constraints. The IssuanceManager also keeps an authoritative record of all outstanding tokenized shares, effectively serving as the source of truth for the cap table at any moment. In summary, a cyberCORP’s equity is digitized into NFTs managed by the IssuanceManager. This design means the company’s entire capitalization table lives on-chain, with each share issuance, transfer, or cancellation recorded immutably. Corporate events like stock issuance, splits, conversions, or cancellations (for example, voiding a certificate that’s been lost or repurchased) are executed via smart contract calls rather than manually updating spreadsheets or centralized services. This not only reduces errors and administrative overhead, but also opens up new possibilities – such as real-time cap table views for investors and programmatic enforcement of rights (e.g. automatically calculating and distributing dividends based on token holdings).
