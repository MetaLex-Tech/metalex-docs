# LeXcheX

LeXcheX brings automated investor accreditation and agreement execution to cyberCORPs. The service issues onchain credentials proving that a wallet belongs to an accredited investor, allowing compliant fundraising without manual review.

## How it fits in cyberCORPs

- **Automated accreditation**: Investors obtain a LeXcheX credential that proves their status without exposing personal data.
- **Onchain compliance**: cyberCORPs can gate token sales or security transfers based on the credential.
- **Streamlined fundraising**: Founders raise capital from qualified investors with fewer intermediaries and lower legal overhead.
