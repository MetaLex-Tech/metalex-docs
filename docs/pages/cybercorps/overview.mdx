# Overview

Why tokenize corporate equity and governance? By putting a corporation’s shares and agreements on Ethereum, cyberCORPs aim to streamline fundraising, cap table management, and decision-making. Legal contracts (like investment agreements) become digital assets – for example, a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) becomes an on-chain token that embodies the legal rights to future stock. This makes rights programmable and composable like DeFi assets, blurring the line between a PDF contract and a token you can hold in a wallet. The benefits include speed and cost efficiency (MetaLeX notes traditional SAFE rounds can incur up to $300K in legal fees – an “absurd” outcome for a “simple” agreement), reduced reliance on middlemen (no lengthy email chains or DocuSign – the code handles execution), and enhanced marketability of equity (shares as tokens can potentially trade peer-to-peer within legal constraints). MetaLeX’s mission is to “network-ify” organizations and agreements, and cyberCORPs are a major step toward that goal. By launching its cyberSAFE application (the first cyberCORP module), MetaLeX demonstrated how a standard startup financing can be transformed into a trust-minimized, automated workflow. In a cyberCORP, raising capital is as simple as using a web app: founders input deal terms and legally register them on-chain, and investors sign and fund the deal through smart contracts. The cyberCORP web app (at [cybercorps.metalex.tech](https://cybercorps.metalex.tech)) guides users through creating a deal – from YC-style SAFEs to more complex token-enhanced deals – entirely on-chain. You draft terms (valuation cap, investment amount, etc.), then the app generates the appropriate agreement for you to review and sign via your wallet. Once signed, the deal is “minted” on-chain and a unique link is provided to share with investors. Investors open the link, connect their wallet to review the terms, and countersign on-chain. Upon mutual acceptance, smart contracts automatically handle payment escrow and token issuance, allowing both parties to track the deal’s progress in real time and see when it’s finalized (or if it expires) via a dashboard. In short, cyberCORPs bring the efficiency and transparency of DeFi to corporate finance, all while preserving the legal enforceability of traditional contracts.
