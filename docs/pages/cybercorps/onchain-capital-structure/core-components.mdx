# Core Components: _IssuanceManager_ and _CyberCertPrinter_

**IssuanceManager Contract:** When a new cyberCORP is launched, it deploys a dedicated **IssuanceManager** smart contract for that company. Think of the IssuanceManager as an on-chain **registrar** or **cap table manager** – it maintains the authoritative record of all the company’s outstanding shares and securities. The IssuanceManager can create and track multiple classes/series of stock or other instruments. It acts as the central controller for equity operations: deploying new token contracts for each security class, minting new shares to investors, recording conversions (e.g. SAFEs converting to equity), and updating the cap table state. In essence, the IssuanceManager is the brain of the on-chain cap table, coordinating all equity-related activities for the cyberCORP.

**CyberCertPrinter Contracts:** For each **class or series of equity** that the company has (for example, _Class A Common Stock_, _Series Seed Preferred Stock_, _Series A Preferred_, etc.), the IssuanceManager deploys a separate **CyberCertPrinter** contract. A CyberCertPrinter is essentially a **digital stock certificate printer**. It’s an ERC-721 NFT contract specialized for a particular type of security (e.g. “Common Stock” or “Preferred Stock”) and, if applicable, a series designation (e.g. “Series A”). When the cyberCORP needs to issue shares of that class, the IssuanceManager calls functions on the corresponding CyberCertPrinter to **mint new NFT-based stock certificates** to the appropriate owner. Each token minted by a CyberCertPrinter represents a **unique stock certificate (share)** in that class/series, complete with metadata and legal details. The cyberCORP may have just one CyberCertPrinter (if it only has one class of stock) or many (one for each class and series of shares or convertible instruments it issues).

_Example:_ Upon cyberCORP initialization, the founder might use the IssuanceManager to create a _Common Stock_ certificate contract and a _Series A Preferred_ contract. These would be two CyberCertPrinter instances, one for each class. Later, if the company authorizes a new series of Preferred Stock (say Series B), the IssuanceManager can deploy another CyberCertPrinter for _Series B Preferred_. This modular design keeps different equities separated but under the common control of the IssuanceManager.

**Under the Hood:** CyberCertPrinter contracts are standard ERC-721 tokens with added logic for corporate compliance. Each CyberCertPrinter is deployed via a minimal proxy pattern (allowing upgradeability behind the scenes), and it’s initialized with parameters like the security’s name, ticker symbol, security class (from a predefined enum such as CommonStock or PreferredStock), and series (Series A, B, Seed, etc.). This configuration ensures that each token contract knows what type of equity it represents. The IssuanceManager keeps a registry of all its CyberCertPrinters, enabling the cyberCORP to query or iterate over all share classes in its cap table.
