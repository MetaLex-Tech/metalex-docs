# Onchain Capital Structure

A **cyberCORP’s capital structure** – its stock ledger and equity issuance – is managed entirely on-chain through a set of smart contracts. This means that a cyberCORP’s shares (and other securities like SAFEs or convertible notes) are **tokenized as NFTs** and recorded on a blockchain rather than on paper or spreadsheets. Every issuance, transfer, or corporate action is executed by code, bringing unprecedented **transparency, automation, and security** to managing a company’s equity. The core of this system is implemented in MetaLeX’s smart contracts (available in the cyberCORPs contracts repository) and accessible via the user-friendly cyberCORPs web app. Below, we break down how this on-chain cap table works and the benefits it provides to founders and investors.
