# Onchain Capital Structure

A **cyberCORP’s capital structure** – its stock ledger and equity issuance – is managed entirely onchain through a set of smart contracts. This means that a cyberCORP’s shares (and other securities like SAFEs or convertible notes) can exist either as **cyberCerts**, NFT-based certificates representing whole securities, or as **cyberScrip**, ERC-20 fungible tokens derived from those certificates. CyberCerts carry the full bundle of shareholder rights, while cyberScrip breaks those rights into liquid units better suited for trading, vesting, or DeFi use. Holders can convert between the two forms through the IssuanceManager, allowing certificates to be “scripified” for flexibility and later recombined into new cyberCerts. Every issuance, transfer, or conversion is executed by code, bringing unprecedented **transparency, automation, and security** to managing a company’s equity. The core of this system is implemented in MetaLeX’s smart contracts (available in the cyberCORPs contracts repository) and accessible via the user-friendly cyberCORPs web app. Below, we break down how this onchain cap table works and the benefits it provides to founders and investors.
