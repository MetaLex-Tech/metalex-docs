# What is a cyberCORP?

## What are cyberCORPs (bizBORGs)?

**cyberCORPs** (sometimes called **bizBORGs**) are onchain corporations – legal companies whose key operations (financing, cap table, governance, etc.) run on blockchain-based smart contracts. They merge traditional legal structures (e.g. an LLC or C-corp) with programmable code. This creates a **governance-accountable, trust-minimized organization** that can operate and fund itself directly on the blockchain. In other words, a cyberCORP uses code to enforce corporate actions and policies, while retaining the familiar roles of real-world businesses (shareholders, directors, etc.). Unlike DAOs with open token governance, or DAO-adjacent BORGs that operate like nonprofit SPVs, cyberCORPs are traditional for-profit business entities at their core, just augmented with blockchain automation for efficiency and transparency. Real-world control and ownership are preserved, but execution is handled digitally onchain. 

## Why Put Corporate Equity and Agreements Onchain?

Tokenizing a company’s shares and contracts unlocks several powerful benefits:

* **Streamlined Fundraising & Lower Costs:** Raising capital becomes faster and far cheaper. For example, a seed round using Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs), Token Warrants, Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), or similar agreements, might ordinarily incur upwards of $25k in legal fees, but with MetaLeX can be automated onchain for a fraction of the cost. By replacing lengthy email chains, bespoke negotiations, and DocuSigns with a slick web interface, standardized deal templates, clear term-setting parameters, and autonomous deal execution code, the process is simplified and legal overhead is slashed.

* **Trust-Minimized Execution:** Onchain deals remove the need to trust intermediaries or manual processes. Smart contracts act as impartial escrow agents and executors – no more chasing signatures or funds, since the code handles enforcement. There’s **no need for middlemen** to coordinate closing; once conditions are met the contract automatically closes the deal.

* **Programmability & Composability:** Equity and contractual rights become **digital assets** when represented by tokens. This makes them programmable and even composable like DeFi assets. For instance, an onchain SAFE (cyberSAFE) token *embodies* the legal right to future stock in the company, blurring the line between a PDF agreement and a token in your wallet. These tokens could potentially interact with other onchain tools – e.g. integrated into automated vesting contracts or used as collateral in compliant lending markets – something impossible with traditional paperwork. We like to think of this as "CorpFi". 

* **Real-Time Transparency:** Every transaction (signing, funding, token issuance, etc.) is recorded on the blockchain, providing an **audit trail** that all parties can monitor in real time. Founders and investors get a live dashboard of the deal’s status (e.g. whether an investment is funded, or a SAFE has converted). This transparency builds trust and helps catch issues (like missed signatures or deadlines) immediately.

* **Enhanced Marketability of Equity:** Tokenized shares or SAFE rights can be made more liquid. Within legal constraints, these security tokens could potentially trade peer-to-peer or be transferred with far less friction than paper shares. While still complying with securities laws (e.g. only trading among authorized investors), this *digitally native equity* is easier to manage and transfer, unlocking new avenues for secondary markets or collateralizing equity.

* **Legal Enforceability Retained:** Critically, putting deals onchain doesn’t mean forsaking the law – each tokenized agreement is still a real legal contract. cyberCORP transactions bring the efficiency and transparency of DeFi to corporate finance **while preserving the legal enforceability of traditional contracts**. Parties have the same legal rights and remedies as with offchain agreements, but benefit from automated execution. In short, you get the best of both worlds: the speed and certainty of code, plus the protection of law.

## Onchain Financing & Dealmaking (CorpFi in Action)

One of the core value propositions of cyberCORPs is **onchain fundraising** – essentially, bringing startup financing into the realm of smart contracts. This is sometimes dubbed **“CorpFi”** (corporate finance via DeFi technology) – and if you enjoy DeFi’s efficiency, **you’ll love CorpFi** for handling compliant financings with minimal friction. MetaLeX’s first cyberCORP module, called **cyberSAFE**, exemplifies this by transforming a standard SAFE raise into a few-click onchain workflow. The result is that **fundraising becomes as easy as using a web app**, with the system automating the heavy lifting. From YC-style SAFEs to more complex hybrid deals, cyberCORPs make fundraising **onchain, programmable, and just a link away**.

**How a cyberSAFE raise works:** (example of an onchain SAFE deal)

1. **Setup:** A founder starts a deal on the cyberCORPs web portal by inputting the key terms – e.g. company name, valuation cap, investment amount, and any special terms. The terms are recorded in a smart contract and used to generate a legally compliant SAFE agreement (the text of the contract is auto-generated for review).

2. **Sign & Tokenize:** The founder signs the SAFE agreement onchain via their wallet. This action “mints” the deal as an onchain asset – effectively turning the contract into a token that represents the investor’s right to future equity. The smart contract also sets up an escrow to hold funds once the investor participates.

3. **Share with Investors:** The platform provides a unique link to the onchain deal. The founder sends this link to prospective investors instead of a PDF. An investor opens the link, connects their Web3 wallet, and can independently review the terms in the embedded agreement.

4. **Investor Participation:** If the investor is satisfied, they sign the SAFE onchain as well and transfer funds (e.g. USDC or ETH) into the deal’s smart contract. **No emails or wire transfers needed** – their wallet signature and payment are all handled in one interface. (MetaLeX’s [LeXcheX](/cyberdeals/lexchex) compliance module can optionally verify the investor’s accreditation onchain to ensure the raise complies with Reg D or other regulations before they’re allowed to fund.)

5. **Automated Closing:** Once the investor has signed and paid, the deal is automatically marked as **accepted**. The smart contract immediately releases the funds to the company’s treasury (or holds them until a specified condition) and issues the SAFE token (or other security token) to the investor, representing their stake. All parties can track this progress on a dashboard in real time. If an investor fails to fund before a deadline, the deal can expire and the tokenized SAFE won’t be issued – all enforced by code without need for manual intervention.

6. **Post-Deal Management:** The cyberCORP platform continues to assist after the closing. The SAFE token can later be converted into equity tokens seamlessly when a triggering event occurs (for example, if the company raises a priced equity round in the future). In fact, deals are tracked through their lifecycle – one can see which rounds are open, which have closed, and which have converted to stock onchain. This end-to-end lifecycle management means less paperwork down the road when updating cap tables or executing future financings.

Through this onchain deal process, raising capital becomes **fast, transparent, and secure**. Founders can focus on building their business instead of coordinating documents and payments, and investors get confidence that their rights are recorded immutably onchain. All of this is achieved with a familiar legal framework (the SAFE) that’s simply been given a tech upgrade – *“a tech-enhanced SAFE that embeds traditional SAFE deal logic into an automated deal process and tokenized security issuance,”* as MetaLeX describes it.

## Onchain Cap Table Management with Tokenized Equity

Moving a company’s equity and obligations onchain not only streamlines the initial fundraising, but also revolutionizes **cap table management**. In a cyberCORP, shares (or future shares promised under instruments like SAFEs) can exist as **tokens** in authorized wallets rather than as entries on a spreadsheet or PDFs in a drawer. This has several implications:

* **Single Source of Truth:** The blockchain effectively *is* the cap table. Ownership of equity is represented by who holds the security tokens. This means no more inconsistent spreadsheets – everyone (founders, investors, regulators) can refer to the onchain record to see the current distribution of shares or SAFE rights.

* **Instant Updates:** When new shares are issued or transferred, the cap table updates in real time as token balances change. Corporate actions like stock splits or option exercises can be executed by minting/burning tokens according to onchain logic, instantly reflecting the new ownership stakes.

* **Easier Transfers (Within Constraints):** Because equity is tokenized, transferring it (subject to legal restrictions) can be as easy as a wallet transaction. For example, if a shareholder in a private company wants to sell some shares to another accredited investor, an onchain transfer can simplify what traditionally involves significant paperwork. The cyberCORP’s smart contracts can enforce any transfer rules – e.g. preventing transfers to unapproved parties or keeping within a certain shareholder limit – so compliance is maintained even as the tokens move. Within those constraints, **shares as tokens can potentially trade peer-to-peer**, improving liquidity for investors.

* **Integration with Financial Tools:** Tokenized equity can plug into other onchain financial primitives. A company could, for instance, use a token-locking module (like MetaLeX’s MetaVesT) to automate vesting schedules for team members, or allow investors to use their equity tokens as collateral in specialized lending platforms. Cap table changes (like new financing rounds) could automatically trigger smart-contract-based notifications or actions (e.g. SAFE tokens converting to stock tokens upon a qualified financing, as noted above).

* **Cap Table Integrity and Auditability:** With every equity transaction onchain, the history of who owned what and when is immutably recorded. This makes due diligence and audits much simpler – one can cryptographically verify the cap table at any point in time. It also reduces the risk of cap table errors or fraudulent share issuances, since all issuances must conform to the code rules and are publicly verifiable on Ethereum.

In summary, onchain cap table management turns what used to be a tedious administrative task into an automated, transparent system. Founders and CFOs get peace of mind that the cap table is always accurate and up-to-date, and investors get clearer insight into their holdings (often viewable in their own wallets or dashboards). The **marketability** of the equity is improved as well – while staying compliant, the tokens give shareholders more flexibility than traditional stock certificates.

## Onchain Corporate Governance & Compliance

Beyond financing, cyberCORPs improve how companies are governed and kept in compliance by encoding certain governance processes in smart contracts. Rather than relying purely on trust and after-the-fact enforcement, a cyberCORP can **enforce corporate policies in real time**. Key aspects of onchain governance in a cyberCORP include:

* **Multi-Sig Executive Control:** At the heart of a cyberCORP is a multi-signature vault (e.g. a Gnosis Safe) that holds the company’s onchain assets and executes transactions. The signers of this multi-sig are the people entrusted with the company’s decisions – for example, the CEO, CFO, and board members (or whatever governance structure the entity chooses). Because the wallet requires a quorum of these signers to authorize actions, it ensures no single actor can run off with funds or make unilateral decisions. This maps closely to traditional governance (board approval for major actions, etc.), but with cryptographic signatures replacing ink signatures.

* **Onchain Policy Guards:** cyberCORPs leverage the MetaLeX **BORGs OS** modules to embed rules (guards) that automatically check transactions against governance policies. For instance, a rule might require that any treasury transfer above \$100k obtains at least 3 of 5 director signatures, or that certain “guarded” actions (like issuing new equity tokens) can only execute after an onchain waiting period (giving time for review or even a token-holder veto if a hybrid DAO model is used). These guards and conditions are coded once and then consistently enforce the agreed governance procedures on every transaction – eliminating the risk of someone bypassing an internal control. Essentially, **real-world corporate controls (board approvals, spending limits, etc.) are separated from but enforced by digital execution**.

* **Automated Compliance Checks:** Compliance requirements that would normally be handled manually by lawyers or compliance officers can be partially automated. We already saw an example with investor accreditation ([LeXcheX](/cyberdeals/lexchex) tokens can represent verified accreditation status and *“slot into any onchain workflow that needs to restrict or log”* such compliance data). Similarly, a cyberCORP could implement whitelist/blacklist modules to comply with sanctions or to ensure tokens only reach permitted jurisdictions. If the company’s bylaws or legal structure impose limits (e.g. no more than 100 shareholders for an LLC, or no transfers until a lockup expires), those rules can be encoded in the smart contracts. This proactive enforcement means the company is **always operating within its legal bounds by default**, rather than relying on after-the-fact correction.

* **Transparent Decision Records:** When corporate decisions are made via onchain actions, it creates a tamper-proof record of governance. For example, if the board of a cyberCORP votes to approve a new token issuance, that approval can be done by each director signing an onchain transaction (or a offchain message recorded onchain). Stakeholders can later verify that, yes, the required approvals were obtained. This transparency holds leaders accountable – no more “shadow actions” that weren’t properly authorized. It’s essentially an automated minute book: every significant action is logged by the system itself.

Crucially, none of this means the human element is removed from governance – rather, the **blockchain acts as a support system for human governance**. cyberCORPs are **not decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)** where anyone with tokens can vote; instead, they are traditional organizations (with CEOs, boards, investors) that use blockchain tools to execute decisions in a consistent, rule-abiding way. The result is a company that’s far less reliant on trust in any one individual’s discretion. It’s easier to trust the system because checks and balances are literally built into the code. As MetaLeX puts it, this approach yields *“governance-accountable, trust-minimized and legally optimized”* corporate structures – meaning the company’s management is both **accountable** (every action requires the proper approvals) and **efficient** (much of the process is automated), all while staying within the bounds of law and legal agreements.

## Conclusion: The CorpFi Revolution

cyberCORPs represent a new frontier in how businesses can be created and operated, bringing the ethos of decentralized finance to the world of corporate finance. This movement – sometimes playfully called **“CorpFi”** – is about using blockchain networks to upgrade the *plumbing* of traditional corporations. By putting equity, agreements, and governance processes on Ethereum, MetaLeX is aiming to **“network-ify” organizations and agreements**. In practical terms, that means turning the cumbersome, trust-heavy parts of running a company into streamlined, transparent, and code-assisted workflows.

The value of cyberCORPs lies in **bridging two worlds**: the reliability and legitimacy of traditional companies on one side, and the innovation and efficiency of crypto networks on the other. Founders can fund their companies faster and more cheaply, investors get enforceable rights delivered in token form, and everyone gains from the real-time transparency and security of blockchain operations. Yet all of this happens without discarding the legal protections and structures that make businesses work – rather, those structures are given superpowers by being implemented in smart contracts.

In summary, a cyberCORP empowers a business to **raise capital, manage ownership, and conduct its affairs onchain** in a way that is compliant and convenient. It’s about re-imagining corporate finance (**CorpFi**) for the internet age: cap tables that update themselves, deals that close with a click, and corporate decisions that execute autonomously but within agreed rules. By leveraging MetaLeX’s cyberCORP framework, entrepreneurs can turn their companies into **“cybernetic organizations”** that are faster, leaner, and more transparent than ever before. It’s a bold step toward a future where **every startup or fund could be part of a blockchain-connected network**, raising and transacting in a trust-minimized way – fulfilling the vision of making organizations as programmable as the rest of the digital world.&#x20;
